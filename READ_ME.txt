1. Open the terminal or command prompt (in Windows).

2. Let us say the file is in /home/username/workspace/NeuralNetworkWeka/src and you are in the 
 home folder as of now then enter cd workspace/Perceptron/src to reach the destination.

3. On arriving at this folder in terminal type javac FileDriver.java.

4. It creates the class files. 

5. Type the command java FileDriver to execute the program which will report the 
output.

6. This should decompress all the zip files that have been kept in the main folder and convert the 
requisite directories of text folders into arff files. So an arff file for train and an arff for test are 
created. This should create the arff files for all the zip files which have both train and test
folders.

7. Scripts/GUI executed in WEKA.

8. The decompressed files will be available in the output folder.
